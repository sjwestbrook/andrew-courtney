          <h2>The Bride</h2>
          <h3>Courtney Sara Keehn</h3>
          <p>Courtney was born and raised in Eau Claire, WI. After high school, she moved to Menomonie to attend the University of Wisconsin-Stout, where her passion for history was born. After two years in Menomonie, Courtney moved back to Eau Claire to attend University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire where she graduated with a degree in history.</p>
          <p>Courtney's past times include shopping, shopping, and more shopping (with coupons, of course)!</p>

          <h2>The Groom</h2>
          <h3>Andrew Joseph Tarcon</h3>
          <p>Andrew was born and raised in Marshfield, WI. Throughout elementary school, junior high, and high school, he was always outside playing football, playing basketball, skateboarding, and snowboarding. During the cold and rainy days, Andrew and his friends would play video games into the wee hours of the morning.</p>
          <p>After graduating high school, Andrew moved to Menomonie, WI to attend the University of Wisconsin-Stout. During this time, he developed a knack for web design and web development.</p>

          <h2>True Love</h2>
          <h3>Courtney &#43; Andrew</h3>
          <p>Courtney and Andrew met over an intense game of Jumbling Towers (knock-off brand of Jenga). After the blocks fell (and Andrew won), they continued their new-found friendship by talking and hanging out every week.</p>
          <p>After a year and a half of dating, Andrew was offered a job to head the web development at a design firm in Seattle, WA. They couldn't pass this up so they headed out to Seattle and continued their relationship. After arriving in Seattle, Courtney got a job as an administrative assistant at a large wholesale grocery cooperative on the West coast.</p>
          <p>One year after moving to Seattle, Andrew got on one knee and proposed to the love of his life.</p>
